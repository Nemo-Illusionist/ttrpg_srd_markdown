# Converting to System Reference Document 5.2.1

This document highlights new and revised elements in each section of System Resource Document 5.2.1 (SRD 5.2.1):

- Playing the Game
- Character Creation
- Classes
- Character Origins
- Feats
- Equipment
- Spells
- Rules Glossary
- Gameplay Toolbox
- Magic Items
- Monsters
- Monsters A–Z
- Animals

Those elements were first introduced in the *Player's Handbook* (2024), *Dungeon Master's Guide* (2024), and *Monster Manual* (2025).

In this document, each element of the new or revised elements has one or more of the following tags so you can see at a glance how it has changed:

**New Name.** This tag is applied to a rule that has a new name. Unless stated otherwise, the rule hasn't changed apart from its name.

**New Rule.** This tag indicates a new rule. **Revised Rule.** This tag indicates a rule that appeared in SRD 5.1 but that has new functionality.

Additionally, the tag "Omitted Rule" indicates stat blocks that are omitted in SRD 5.2.1 but have recommended replacements. Following these sections is guidance on capitalization.

## Using This Guide

When you're updating content from SRD 5.1 to SRD 5.2.1, follow these steps:

1. **Apply New Names.** Check the new names here and update any renamed terms in your content accordingly.
2. **Check for Rules Changes by Content Type.** Consider the kind of content you're updating, and check for changes to the kind of rules it depends on. For example, if you're publishing subclasses, make sure they still match the structure of the classes they're meant for. If you're publishing monsters, apply the changes to the stat block format.
3. **Update Capitalization.** Many more game terms are capitalized in SRD 5.2.1 than in 5.1; update their capitalization in your content to match.

## Playing the Game

The "Playing the Game" section includes the following new and revised elements, which are presented in the order in which they appear in that section.

### D20 Tests

#### D20 Test [New Name]

"D20 Test" is the new umbrella term for ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. If a rule applies to all three, you now use this term rather than listing all three terms.

#### Heroic Inspiration [New Rule]

The inspiration rule has been replaced by Heroic Inspiration, which is a reroll rather than Advantage.

### Proficiency

#### Tool Proficiency [Revised Rule]

If you have proficiency with both the tool and the skill that are used for an ability check, you automatically have Advantage on the check, in addition to adding your Proficiency Bonus.

### Actions

#### Attack Action [Revised Rule]

The Attack action contains several revisions:

- The action now specifies that it involves an attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
- The action now allows you to equip or unequip one weapon with each attack you make with the action.
- The ability to move between attacks during combat is now a function of the Attack action rather than a general rule.

#### Help

Assisting an ally with an ability check is now limited by a creature's skill and tool proficiencies as well as proximity to the ally.

#### Hide Action [Revised Rule]

The rules for hiding have moved into the Hide action.

#### Influence Action [New Rule]

The rules on influencing monsters through ability checks have moved into a new action: the Influence action.

### Magic Action [New Name, Revised Rule]

The Magic action is used to cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature. The Cast a Spell action has been absorbed into this action.

The descriptions of class features and magic items now use this action if they require an action to activate, and effects like *Antimagic Field* prevent this action's use.

#### Search Action

The previous Search action's function has been divided into the Search action and the new Study action (see below). The new search action encompasses Wisdom checks to discern hidden things, such as Wisdom (Perception) checks to find a concealed creature.

#### Study Action [New Rule]

The Study action encompasses Intelligence checks to recall something or study a book or other source of knowledge. Class features, such as the Wizard's new Scholar feature, and other character benefits can now build on this action.

#### Utilize Action [New Name]

The Use an Object action is now called the Utilize action.

### Combat

#### Surprise [Revised Rule]

Being surprised no longer deprives you of the ability to act on your first turn of combat. Instead, being surprised causes you to have Disadvantage on your Initiative roll.

#### Dropping Prone [Revised Rule]

A creature can't make itself Prone if its Speed is 0.

#### Moving around Other Creatures [Revised Rule]

Here are the changes to this rule:

- You can move through the space of an Incapacitated creature.
- An ally's space no longer counts as Difficult Terrain for you.
- You can now move through the space of a Tiny creature that isn't an ally, and that creature's space doesn't count as Difficult Terrain for you.
- If you somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the Prone condition unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.

#### Underwater Combat [Revised Rule]

Previously, a list of specific weapons avoided the Disadvantage that is imposed on the attack rolls of a creature that lacks a Swim Speed. In the revised rule, any weapon that deals Piercing damage avoids the Disadvantage.

### Damage and Healing

#### Saving Throws and Damage [Revised Rule]

Previously, any effect that dealt damage to a group of targets simultaneously required the damage to be rolled once for all the targets. In the revised rules, that rule—rolling once for all the targets—applies only to saving throw effects.

#### Knocking Out a Creature [Revised Rule]

This rule now causes the Unconscious creature to have 1 Hit Point, not 0, and causes it to start a Short Rest. The Unconscious condition ends on the creature if it regains any Hit Points.

## Character Creation

"Character Creation" contains new and revised elements. The order of steps differs from in SRD 5.1; they are presented in the order in which they now appear.

### Create Your Character

This new section sets forth the steps to create a character in an order different from previous rules.

#### Note Armor Training [Revised Rule]

The ability to wear armor effectively is called armor training, not armor proficiency.

#### Character Origin [Revised Rule]

Your character's origin incorporates two items with revised rules:

**Choose a Background.** Your choice of background provides several key rules elements: ability score increases, an Origin feat, skill and tool proficiencies, and some of your starting equipment.

**Choose a Species.** Your choice of species, previously called race, provides certain traits and determines your character's size and Speed. Species don't provide ability score increases or languages, nor do species influence a character's alignment.

Additionally, the language tables are revised.

#### Character Origin [New Rule]

Your character's origin incorporates a new item:

**Choose Languages.** All characters choose two languages in addition to Common. These choices are independent of background and species selection. The choices of standard languages and rare languages are revised.

Additionally, Common Sign Language is a new language.

#### Adjust Ability Scores [Revised Rule]

Ability score adjustments come from a character's background, not from the character's species.

#### Step 5: Character Creation Details [New Name, Revised Rule]

Several rules have been consolidated into this step under the name "Fill In Numbers." These rules include noting proficiency in saving throws and skills, determining starting Hit Points, and explaining spellcasting rules that apply to all spellcasting classes.

### Level Advancement

Fixed Hit Points received by each class are presented here under this new name, rather than in each class's features.

#### Tiers of Play [New Rule]

This section, including the "Starting Equipment at Higher Levels" table and the "Bonus Feats at Level 20" sidebar, is new.

The ability score prerequisites for multiclassing now appear in each class description, so this rule refers to the class descriptions.

The proficiencies and armor training you gain for multiclassing now appear in each class description, so this rule refers to the class descriptions.
